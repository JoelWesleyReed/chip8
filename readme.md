Chip8 Emulator
==============

This is a Chip8 emulator for Mac OS X.  It is a Xcode workspace with 2 projects: an emulator library and a Cocoa interface, both implemented in Objective-C.  It implements an debugger that allows stepping through a chip8 program one opcode at a time and displaying the contents of all of the registers.  I created it as a refresher course on Objective-C and to learn how Cocoa interfaces are implemented.
